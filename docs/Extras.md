**THIS PAGE NEEDS UPDATING!**

**⚠ THIS SCRIPT SHOULD NOT BE RUN DIRECTLY BY THE USER!** 

It should be run through the `main.py` file instead. Use the **E** option at the main menu.

This page will go over some of the features in the Extras menu, without too much detail.

***
## 1. Create and import XML file

This option allows you to automatically convert a QEMU config script previously generated by AutoPilot into an XML file compatible with **virt-manager** (Virtual Machine Manager), which is a GUI frontend that makes management of your VMs easier and nicer to work with. 

After conversion, you'll have the option to automatically import the XML file into virt-manager.

## 2. VFIO-PCI passthrough assistant
If AutoPilot wasn't tiring enough for me to make, this takes the cake. It's an extension to AutoPilot itself - providing you with an easy(ier) way to correctly set up your config file with VFIO-PCI devices.

After completing AutoPilot, you're left with a bare-bones / no-frills macOS virtual machine that has been customised to your liking. This itself is probably enough for most people. But, if you demand more and are categorically not "most people" - this is for you. 

Providing you have [a compatible GPU](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/Main-Menu#3-check-gpu-compatibility), you can
use this assistant to utilise GPU passthrough and enable 3D acceleration in macOS.

## 3. Create a backup of config files
**✖ THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!**

A cute 'lil script made to save you from yourself when you inevitably do something really, really stupid. 

***
## 4. Dump VBIOS to ROM file
**✖ THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!**

Utilising the Linux filesystem's sexy device management, this script lets you easily dump your GPU's VBIOS to a ROM file for use with VFIO-PCI passthrough. *This isn't always required*, but depends on your specific GPU.

***
## R. Reset OpenCore image and vNVRAM
**☢ THIS IS INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE!**

This project is set up to try and make your oopsie-whoopsies as painless as possible, by providing you with plenty of opportunities to back up your personal config files and images. 

Aside from backups, the project also keeps fresh copies of its main components stashed in its resources folder, for safe keeping *from you*. 

Basically, this means that if you somehow corrupt your OpenCore boot image, or something in the virtual NVRAM, you can overwrite it with a fresh working copy from the repo's secret stash. This option is like a "soft-reset", and doesn't affect your config files or virtual hard disk files - just the virtual bootloader and NVRAM.

***
## X. Download and restore all 
**☢ THIS IS INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE!**

Now you've done it. The biggest oopsie-whoopsie f*cky-wucky of them all - and my repo has been tainted with your mess. Somehow, if you have to use this option, you've messed up **so badly** that you feel like you have to reset the repo itself. 

While this *shouldn't* be destructive for *your* personal files (i.e. configs and vHDDs) it carries some risk as it will clear and reset all of the projects files with online copies. The latest version of the repo's files will be downloaded regardless of your current version - so unlike the built-in updater script there are no safety measures to account for any dramatic discrepancies between local and remote versions.
